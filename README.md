### Algorithms
> Various computer science and magical wing wongs, from sorting to pathfinding algorithms
1. **Game Dev Algo**
    * **[A* Algorithm / A Pathfinding Algorithm](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/AStarComparison.html)** - In itself is self-explanatory.
    * **[Perlin Noise / A Procedural Generation Algorithm](https://www.redblobgames.com/articles/noise/introduction.html)** - Probably the best algorithm and easiest one I can understand in procedural generation; procedural generation is the random generation of content in a game like the terrains in Minecraft and most rouge-like games.

### Linguistics
> Ever since the Tower of Babel, life has been made difficult to communicate with other people.
> Here can be some useful resources for learning a new language! No, not a programming language.

1. **Tools**
    * **[Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/home/)** - A free online memorization tool for learning new vocab; also please follow [me](https://www.memrise.com/user/OxygenJam/).
  
2. **Japanese**

   | JLPT Level | Proficiency Level |
   | --- | --- |
   | N5 | Some basic understanding of Japanese|
   | N4 | Basic understanding of Japanese |
   | N3 | Basic understanding of Japanese used in the everyday aspect (Semi-fluency) |
   | N2 | Highschool level of Japanese (Fluency) |
   | N1 | More than fluent enough to flirt your way to some Japanese people |    
    * **Genki I and II** - A great book for those learning from beginner up to N4.
    * **Tobira** - This is the next step after Genki, mostly from N4 to N2.
    * **Remembering the kanji by Heisig** - It's recommended by others, I somewhat find it useful.
